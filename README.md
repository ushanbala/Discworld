# DiscWorld: A 2D AI Agent Realm (Python Backend, HTML Frontend)

**DiscWorld** is a Python-based system that simulates a simple 2D world where users can create and deploy AI agents. This realm is structured as an office space, featuring a hierarchical organization with a CEO, a Manager, and multiple Employee AI agents (created by users). Tasks are introduced into the system, processed by the management structure, and then executed concurrently by the employee agents.

## Overview

DiscWorld provides a unique environment for observing and interacting with autonomous AI agents within a simulated organizational structure. The system mimics a simplified office workflow:

1.  **Task Initiation:** Tasks are introduced to the system, either manually by a user or automatically generated by the system itself.
2.  **CEO Delegation:** The initial task is assigned to the CEO AI agent.
3.  **Managerial Analysis and Decomposition:** The CEO delegates the task to the Manager AI agent. The Manager analyzes the task, breaks it down into smaller, manageable sub-tasks, and identifies suitable Employee agents for each sub-task.
4.  **Concurrent Employee Execution:** The Manager distributes the sub-tasks to the available Employee AI agents. These agents then work concurrently to execute their assigned portions of the overall task.
5.  **Automated Task Cycle (Optional):** The system can be configured to automatically generate new tasks upon the completion of previous ones, creating a continuous cycle of task creation, delegation, execution, and feedback.
6.  **Simple 2D World Representation:** The office space and the agents within it are visually represented in a simple 2D environment (rendered via the HTML frontend).

## Key Features

* **2D Office Space Simulation:** A visual representation of the realm, including the CEO, Manager, and Employee agents within an office environment (rendered by the HTML frontend).
* **AI Agent Creation:** Users can create custom AI agents (Employees) with potentially different capabilities or specializations (implementation details depend on the complexity).
* **Hierarchical Task Management:** Tasks flow through a defined organizational structure (CEO -> Manager -> Employees).
* **Task Decomposition:** The Manager AI agent analyzes and breaks down complex tasks into smaller, actionable sub-tasks.
* **Concurrent Task Execution:** Employee AI agents work on their assigned sub-tasks simultaneously.
* **Manual Task Input:** Users can directly input tasks into the system, assigning them to the CEO.
* **Automated Task Generation (Optional):** The system can be configured to automatically generate new tasks upon the completion of previous ones, driving continuous activity within the realm.
* **Python Backend:** The core logic for agent behavior, task management, and world simulation is implemented in Python.
* **Simple HTML User Interface:** A basic HTML interface provides a visual representation of the DiscWorld and potentially allows for user interaction (e.g., task input, agent creation - specific interaction capabilities depend on implementation).

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language for the backend logic, including AI agent behavior, task management, and world simulation.
* **HTML:** Used to create the simple user interface for visualizing the 2D world and potentially interacting with the system.
* **(Potentially):**
    * JavaScript (for dynamic updates and interactions on the HTML frontend).
    * Libraries for AI agent development (e.g., basic decision-making logic, planning algorithms).
    * Libraries for managing concurrent execution (e.g., `threading`, `asyncio`).

## Core Functionality 

1.  **World Initialization:** The Python backend sets up the 2D office space and initializes the CEO and Manager AI agents.
2.  **Agent Creation:** Users interact with the HTML frontend (potentially sending requests to the Python backend) to create new Employee AI agents, defining their initial attributes or capabilities.
3.  **Task Input:** Users can input tasks through the HTML interface, which are then received by the Python backend and assigned to the CEO.
4.  **Task Processing:**
    * The CEO receives the task.
    * The CEO delegates the task to the Manager.
    * The Manager analyzes the task and decomposes it into sub-tasks.
    * The Manager assigns sub-tasks to available Employee agents.
    * Employee agents execute their assigned sub-tasks (the nature of this execution depends on the agent's programmed behavior).
5.  **Task Completion:** Once all sub-tasks for a main task are completed, the system (likely managed by the Manager or a central controller in the Python backend) recognizes the completion.
6.  **Automated Task Cycle (if enabled):** Upon task completion, the Python backend generates a new task and assigns it to the CEO, restarting the cycle.
7.  **Frontend Visualization:** The HTML frontend periodically updates the 2D representation of the office space and the agents, potentially showing their status or activity.

## Potential Use Cases

* Simulating basic organizational workflows and task management.
* Providing a simplified environment for experimenting with basic AI agent behavior and interaction.
* Educational purposes for understanding task delegation and concurrent processing.
* Creating a visual representation of a multi-agent system.
* A foundation for building more complex simulated environments with AI agents.

## Future Enhancements

* More sophisticated AI agent behaviors and capabilities.
* A more interactive and visually rich frontend using technologies like JavaScript and Canvas.
* Different types of office environments or realms.
* More complex task dependencies and resource management.
* Agent communication and collaboration.
* Logging and visualization of agent activities and task progress.
* User interface for managing and monitoring agents.
